My checkout process is designed for simplicity. Users can review their selected items, enter shipping information, and securely provide payment details. The system automatically calculates the total cost, providing users with a clear understanding of their purchase.

### Responsive Design

I understand the importance of accessibility. My website is fully responsive, ensuring a consistent and enjoyable experience across various devices, be it a desktop, tablet, or smartphone.
